## Description - Three part project

The first part will essentially be creating a blackjack game from scratch.

Second part will be creating a simulator for the game. This will play the game X amount of times vs. the dealer. Both the dealer rules and the player strategy will be customizable.

Finally, I will attempt to create some sort of AI that will play the game and attempt to optimize the win % over time, in addition to optimizing the money won.

## Motivation

My main motivation for this project just stems from simple curiousity. They say that given best odds at a casino and playing "basic strategy", you can bring your win % up to 49% on average. Obviously with a low sample size, we see people either making or losing a lot of money.

The nice thing about this sort of project is that I am not sure if anyone has done something similar to this. I'm not super interested in using this to create an AI that I can bring to the casinos with me, I'm more interested in getting the data and learning something. Another nice thing about bringing AI into gambling, is that maybe the most optimized form of an AI is actually a losing (<50%) win rate, but the amount of money it wins heavily outweighs the amount that it loses, even if it loses more frequently. The losing win rate, yet profiting was inspired by a certain company I had visited recently.

## Goals

I will attempt to update this with goals when I see fit. For now, I will list off some main goals.

- Fully functional blackjack game. Player against computer with customizable house rules.
- Simulator that follows set rules for the player and set rules for the computer and simulates some large # of hands played and finds the win rate and $ gain/loss afterwards.
- Generate lots of data using this simulator and find some way to visualize it.
- If the performance is slow, migrate this project over to C++ or some other lower-level language that can give performance boosts.
- Learn lots about python! I have only ever used Python for very small projects and hackathons. I wish to learn more and get accustomed to best practices.
